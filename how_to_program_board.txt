This project uses openOCD and a makefile to program the psi_blade controller board
The board had a atsamd21g18a.
The board needs between 7-8V to be properly powered. The cpu should work with a lower supply voltage.
Use the AVR connection on atmel-ice
A openOCD server needs to be running before "make debug" will work.
To start server type "openocd" when in the same folder as the makefile and the openocd.cfg files.
A degging server will then start if the debugger is connected to a powered board.

Open a second cmd and use following commands to load the program onto the cpu.

commands:
	make 			- compile and link
	make debug 		- open a gdb session with the *.elf file created by make
	(gdb) load		- load file to board
	(gdb) monitor reset 	- reset board to start program execution
	(gdb) quit		- quit the gdb session
